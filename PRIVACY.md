# Privacy Policy for Belair SFTP Discord Bot

_Last updated: June 19, 2025_

## 1. Data Collected
The Belair SFTP Discord Bot only temporarily handles:
- **Usernames entered in the app** for validation purposes.
- **Randomly generated login keys** which are sent to a specific Discord channel.

No additional personal data is collected, stored, or shared.

## 2. Data Storage
The bot **does not store any data** permanently. All keys and username references are used in real-time and are not retained after the session ends.

## 3. Data Sharing
No user data is shared with third parties. The only visible data is the key message posted in the designated private Discord channel.

## 4. Security
Reasonable measures are taken to ensure that keys are sent securely within Discord, but absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## 5. Your Rights
Since no personally identifiable data is stored, there is no user data to delete or manage.

## 6. Changes to Privacy Policy
This privacy policy may be updated without prior notice. Continued use of the bot implies acceptance of the updated policy.

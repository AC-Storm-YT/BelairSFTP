## Privacy Policy  
_Last updated: June 20, 2025_

### 1. Data Collected and Processed  
The Belair SFTP Discord Bot processes the following data specifically for the purpose of authenticating user logins within the Belair SFTP application:

- Messages from a specific, designated Discord channel that contain user account information created and managed by authorized staff.
- Usernames entered within the Belair SFTP application for real-time validation.
- Randomly generated login keys sent to the designated Discord channel.

The bot reads account information directly from the messages in the specified channel to verify whether users have a valid account and to allow them to log in to the application.

The data is processed in real-time only and is **not stored permanently**.

### 2. Data Storage  
The bot does not permanently store any user data, messages, or login keys. All processed data is temporary and automatically discarded after the authentication process is completed.

### 3. Data Sharing  
The bot does not share any user data with third parties. Messages and login keys remain visible only in the designated private Discord channel controlled by authorized staff.

### 4. Security  
Reasonable care is taken to process data securely via Discord’s infrastructure, but absolute security cannot be guaranteed. Use of the bot is at your own risk.

### 5. User Rights  
Since the bot does not permanently store any user data, no user data is subject to deletion or management requests.

### 6. Changes to Privacy Policy  
This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the bot constitutes acceptance of any future updates.
